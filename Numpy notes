Numpy Project


1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.

NumPy is a python library used for working with arrays. 
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. 
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. 
It is an open source project and you can use it freely. NumPy stands for Numerical Python

(https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy_intro.asp)

NumPy is an open-source numerical Python library. 
NumPy contains a multi-dimensional array and matrix data structures. 
It can be utilised to perform a number of mathematical operations on arrays such as trigonometric, statistical,
and algebraic routines.
Therefore, the library contains a large number of mathematical, algebraic, and transformation functions.
NumPy is an extension of Numeric and Numarray.
Numpy also contains random number generators.
NumPy is a wrapper around a library implemented in C.
Pandas objects rely heavily on NumPy objects. Essentially, Pandas extends Numpy.


Most Important Numpy Data Types:
One-dimensional array
Multi-dimensional array
Others: 
Boolean
Integer (signed and unsigned)
Float
Complex
